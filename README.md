Arizona's Water Assessment Calculator takes data from the water quality portal (www.waterqualitydata.us) and determines assessment decisions at the parameter, use and waterbody levels.  Arizona uses this tool to make weekly provisional impairment and impairment removal decisions and to report this information to the Environmental Protection Agency through the ATTAINS system every two years (https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/attains).  

This is a public repository for the code used to build the tool.  The code relies on connections to ADEQ's water quality database for standards and to relate monitoring locations to assessment units.  Connection information to this database has been removed from the code for security.
